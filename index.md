# RetroArch + AI


Custom version of RetroArch and library where you can use a model to override player input which means you can play against custom AI for multiplayer games such as Virtua Figher, Mortal Kombat, NHL94, etc. You can also override your own input and let the model play for you or even make two models fight against each other.

Easily accessible from the Quick Menu.
