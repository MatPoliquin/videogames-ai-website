## Temperatures and stability
![wwfmania](/assets/hardware/x88-t8d_temps.png)

Stress testing the two Intel Xeon E5 2666v3 CPUs at 100% results in a peak temperature of 61C for the CPUs and 59C for the motherboard.


I bought this board when I was in Shanghai and traveled all the way to Canada with it so I was worried that it broke underway but have been using this board for a few weeks now with Ubuntu 18.04, running 24/7 and got zero crashes.

The only thing I noticed when I bought the board is the bent reset button on the left, next to the power button. It still works well thought.

## Conclusion


For server or workstation needs, x99 motherboards are still very well supported by Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux and offers the best bang for the buck since you can use the very cheap but still powerful Intel E5 Xeon 2666v3 with DDR3 RAM with no performance penality compared to DDR4 (check out this video by Myiconst). Even for x99 boards and processors that supports only DDR4 (there is also a DDR4 variant of this board) the price/performance ratio is still very interesting.

New x99 boards are still beeing produced, as in this case the x99-t8D by the Chinese company Huananzhi.
