There is a lot of reviews for the Asus Zephyrus g14 2022 already that covers mostly gaming and productivity benchmarks but none to date(as far as I know) covers the g14 Machine Learning capabilities and while some do, few talks about thermals and linux support. So I will cover mostly those topics

I bought the base model you can find the full specs here but here are the main points:

The specs:
*   AMD 6800HS 8C/16T
*   2x 8GB DDR5 @4800Mhz
*   AMD RX 6700s 8GB DDR6
*   512GB PCIE 4.0 SSD
*   1920x1200 14" screen

Software:
*   BIOS 317


## Machine Learning


## Ubuntu 22.10


## Thermals, fan noise and coil whine
